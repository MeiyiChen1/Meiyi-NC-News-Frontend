# Meiyi NC News ‚Äì (Frontend)
### A interactive comment style News web app built with React, interacting with a custom NC News API (React/HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

üöÄ **[Live Demo](https://meiyi-nc-news.netlify.app)**

### **Features**

‚úî Planning

Planned and executed a full CRUD React application from wireframes to deployment, following a structured planning phase to define:

- Wireframes for all routes (homepage, article view, comments).

- Component tree with data flow (props vs. state) and API integration strategy.

- User context (hardcoded authenticated user) for seamless comment/delete functionality.

‚úî CRUD Operations

- Browse articles by topic, sort by votes/date.

- View article details with nested comments.

- Upvote/downvote articles (optimistic UI updates).

- Post/delete comments (hardcoded user).

‚úî User Experience

- Accessible routing (React Router).

- Error handling (404, API failure fallbacks).

‚úî Testing

- 50+ unit/integration tests (Jest + React Testing Library).

- End-to-end test coverage for critical flows.

‚úî Delivered core features aligned with Agile principles:

- The articles page with the article card included key information for each article

- Article detail pages with comments and real-time voting (PATCH)

- User interactions: Post/delete comments (POST/DELETE), vote on articles (optimistic UI updates)

- Error handling: 404 pages, API failure fallbacks, and input validation

- Deployed on Netlify with CI/CD, ensuring automated testing and live accessibility


### **Tech Stack**

**Frontend**: React | Axios | React Router | Context API (state) | CSS3

**Testing**: Jest | React Testing Library

**Deployment**: Netlify (CI/CD)

**API**: NC News Backend (Node.js/Express/PostgreSQL)

### **Project Planning**
A structured approach ensured efficiency:

- Avaliable endpoints summary from Backend Api

- Wireframes ‚Äì Designed all views (homepage, article, comments).

- Component Tree ‚Äì Mapped data flow (props/state) and API calls.

- UX Considerations ‚Äì Prioritized accessibility and fluid interactions.
